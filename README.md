 Lorenz Attractor Visualization

This project visualizes the **Lorenz Attractor** using `pygame` for graphical representation and matrix transformations for 3D rotations.

## Features
- Simulates and visualizes the Lorenz Attractor.
- Uses 3D rotation matrices to dynamically rotate the attractor.
- Projects 3D points onto a 2D plane for rendering.
- Implements HSV-to-RGB color mapping for a visually appealing effect.

## Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following dependencies:
```sh
pip install pygame
